By publishing to NPM we are able to distribute our reusable modules to other GitHub properties.\n\nModules are grouped into three packages:\n- **primer-core:** modules that are used for dotcom as well as marketing websites\n- **primer-product:** modules that are only used on dotcom\n- **primer-marketing:** modules that are only used on marketing websites and occasionally for promotional content on dotcom\n\nYou can add module packages by including any or all of the following imports in your bundle:","position":{"start":{"line":177,"column":1,"offset":11206},"end":{"line":191,"column":4,"offset":12129},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"@import \"primer-core/index.scss\"\n@import \"primer-product/index.scss\"\n@import \"primer-marketing/index.scss\"","position":{"start":{"line":192,"column":1,"offset":12130},"end":{"line":194,"column":38,"offset":12236},"indent":[1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":192,"column":1,"offset":12130},"end":{"line":194,"column":38,"offset":12236},"indent":[1,1]}},{"type":"code","lang":null,"meta":null,"value":"### Creating a module\n\n1. Create a new repository on https://github.com/primer that will be the location for your module. Only the design systems team have write access to that repository. If you don't have access, ask in #design-systems and someone will create a folder for you.\n2. Create a new folder inside one of the primer directories (core, product, or marketing), and within the appropriate styles folder (components, objects, utilities etc.). This folder cannot be inside another module with a `package.json` file.\n3. Inside the folder you'll need at least a `package.json` file. Here is an example of what you'll need in the package file. The main thing it's looking for are `name, version, and repository`. The publish script uses this to push to the distribution repository.\n\n    ```js\n    {\n      \"name\": \"module-name\",\n      \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n      \"description\": \"\",\n      \"homepage\": \"https://github.com/styleguide\",\n      \"license\": \"MIT\",\n      \"repository\": \"https://github.com/primer/primer.git\",\n      \"main\": \"utilities.scss\",\n      \"bugs\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://github.com/primer/primer/issues\"\n      },\n      \"author\": \"GitHub, Inc.\",\n      \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n      },\n      \"keywords\": [\n        \"primer\",\n        \"css\",\n        \"github\",\n        \"primercss\"\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n5. The directory layout should typically be like this:\n\n    ```\n    a-module/\n      ├── lib/\n      │   ├── partial.scss\n      │   └── partial.scss\n      ├── index.scss\n      ├── README.md\n      └── package.json\n    ```\n\n    Create a stylesheet named `index.scss`. In this file include a list of relative imports for the partials required, like the example below:\n\n    ```scss\n    @import \"primer-support/index.scss\";\n    @import \"./lib/button.scss\";\n    @import \"./lib/button-group.scss\";\n    ```\n\n    Add a `README` to give some info on the module and how to install it, and a documentation section. Here's an example of the [buttons README](https://github.com/primer/primer/blob/master/README.md).\n\n### Publishing changes and new modules\n\nOnce you have your directory setup, you will be ready to publish the module.\n\nTo publish, there are two requirements. First, you must be on the `master` branch. Second, all changes should be committed and synced with the remote `master`. These requirements protect us from changes being overwritten. Once you're on `master` run `script/css-modules --help` to get a list of all the available commands. This script will help with versioning and publishing.\n\n#### Versioning\n\nPrimer CSS follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) conventions. This helps others know when a change is a patch, minor, or breaking change.\n\nTo understand what choice to make, you'll need to understand semver and know if one of the changes shown is a major, minor, or patch. Semver is confusing at first, so I recommend reviewing [semver](http://semver.org/) and/or ask in [#design-systems](https://github.slack.com/archives/design-systems) or and experienced open-source contributor.\n\n\nexport const _frontmatter = {\"title\":\"Contributing\",\"path\":\"getting-started/contributing\"}","position":{"start":{"line":195,"column":1,"offset":12237},"end":{"line":263,"column":91,"offset":15411},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":263,"column":91,"offset":15411}}},"scopeImports":[],"scopeIdentifiers":[],"rawMDXOutput":"/* @jsx mdx */\nimport { mdx } from '@mdx-js/react';\n/* @jsx mdx */\n\n\nconst makeShortcode = name => function MDXDefaultShortcode(props) {\n  console.warn(\"Component \" + name + \" was not imported, exported, or provided by MDXProvider as global scope\")\n  return <div {...props}/>\n};\n\nconst layoutProps = {\n  \n};\nconst MDXLayout = \"wrapper\"\nexport default function MDXContent({\n  components,\n  ...props\n}) {\n  return <MDXLayout {...layoutProps} {...props} components={components} mdxType=\"MDXLayout\">\n    <p>{`Guidelines for contributing to GitHub's CSS.`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"#decision-process-for-adding-new-styles\"\n        }}>{`Decision process for adding new styles`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"#step-by-step-instructions-for-adding-new-styles\"\n        }}>{`Step-by-step instructions for adding new styles`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"#documentation-structure\"\n        }}>{`Documentation structure`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"#primer-css-modules\"\n        }}>{`Primer CSS modules`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"#ship-checklist\"\n        }}>{`Ship checklist`}</a></li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>{`Decision process for adding new styles`}</h2>\n    <h3>{`Components`}</h3>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/css/components\"\n      }}>{`Components`}</a>{` are frequently used visual patterns we've abstracted into a set of convenient styles, that would be otherwise difficult to achieve with utilities and layout objects.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Making a decision on whether new components should be added is done on a case by case basis.

Modules are folders with a specific structure that include CSS, a \\`package.json\\`, and other files for publishing to repositories in our GitHub Primer organization and NPM.\n\nThe source of truth for our CSS will be in the github/github codebase, but we publish updates to NPM whenever styles in github/github are changed. By publishing to NPM we are able to distribute our reusable modules to other GitHub properties.\n\nModules are grouped into three packages:\n- **primer-core:** modules that are used for dotcom as well as marketing websites\n- **primer-product:** modules that are only used on dotcom\n- **primer-marketing:** modules that are only used on marketing websites and occasionally for promotional content on dotcom\n\nYou can add module packages by including any or all of the following imports in your bundle:\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`@import \"primer-core/index.scss\"\n@import \"primer-product/index.scss\"\n@import \"primer-marketing/index.scss\"`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{`### Creating a module\n\n1. Create a new repository on https://github.com/primer that will be the location for your module. Only the design systems team have write access to that repository. If you don't have access, ask in #design-systems and someone will create a folder for you.\n2. Create a new folder inside one of the primer directories (core, product, or marketing), and within the appropriate styles folder (components, objects, utilities etc.). This folder cannot be inside another module with a \\`package.json\\` file.\n3. Inside the folder you'll need at least a \\`package.json\\` file. Here is an example of what you'll need in the package file. The main thing it's looking for are \\`name, version, and repository\\`. The publish script uses this to push to the distribution repository.\n\n    \\`\\`\\`js\n    {\n      \"name\": \"module-name\",\n      \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n      \"description\": \"\",\n      \"homepage\": \"https://github.com/styleguide\",\n      \"license\": \"MIT\",\n      \"repository\": \"https://github.com/primer/primer.git\",\n      \"main\": \"utilities.scss\",\n      \"bugs\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://github.com/primer/primer/issues\"\n      },\n      \"author\": \"GitHub, Inc.\",\n      \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": \"echo \\\\\"Error: no test specified\\\\\" && exit 1\"\n      },\n      \"keywords\": [\n        \"primer\",\n        \"css\",\n        \"github\",\n        \"primercss\"\n      ]\n    }\n    \\`\\`\\`\n\n5. The directory layout should typically be like this:\n\n    \\`\\`\\`\n    a-module/\n      ├── lib/\n      │   ├── partial.scss\n      │   └── partial.scss\n      ├── index.scss\n      ├── README.md\n      └── package.json\n    \\`\\`\\`\n\n    Create a stylesheet named \\`index.scss\\`. In this file include a list of relative imports for the partials required, like the example below:\n\n    \\`\\`\\`scss\n    @import \"primer-support/index.scss\";\n    @import \"./lib/button.scss\";\n    @import \"./lib/button-group.scss\";\n    \\`\\`\\`\n\n    Add a \\`README\\` to give some info on the module and how to install it, and a documentation section. Here's an example of the [buttons README](https://github.com/primer/primer/blob/master/README.md).\n\n### Publishing changes and new modules\n\nOnce you have your directory setup, you will be ready to publish the module.\n\nTo publish, there are two requirements. First, you must be on the \\`master\\` branch. Second, all changes should be committed and synced with the remote \\`master\\`. These requirements protect us from changes being overwritten. Once you're on \\`master\\` run \\`script/css-modules --help\\` to get a list of all the available commands. This script will help with versioning and publishing.\n\n#### Versioning\n\nPrimer CSS follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) conventions. This helps others know when a change is a patch, minor, or breaking change.\n\nTo understand what choice to make, you'll need to understand semver and know if one of the changes shown is a major, minor, or patch. Semver is confusing at first, so I recommend reviewing [semver](http://semver.org/) and/or ask in [#design-systems](https://github.slack.com/archives/design-systems) or and experienced open-source contributor.\n\n\nexport const _frontmatter = {\"title\":\"Contributing\",\"path\":\"getting-started/contributing\"}\n`}</code></pre>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
