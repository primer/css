### Extended spacing scale
This module extends the `primer-core` spacing scale for marketing site needs. These are useful for achieving bigger vertical spacing between sections on marketing sites.

Starting where the `primer-core` spacing scale ends at spacer 6, the marketing scale first steps up with `8px` for spacer 7 then steps in increments of `16px` from spacer 8 up to 12.

| Scale | Value |
|-------|-------|
| 7     | 48    |
| 8     | 64    |
| 9     | 80    |
| 10    | 96    |
| 11    | 112   |
| 12    | 128   |

See [primer-marketing-support](https://npm.im/primer-marketing-support) for the extended spacing scale used for marketing needs and the related y-axis spacing utilities for [margin](/css/utilities/marketing-margin) and [padding](/css/utilities/marketing-padding).
