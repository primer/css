We use and ❤️ [Kapeli's Dash app][dash] for browsing API documentation. Dash comes with 150+ offline documentation sets, but doesn't have our style guide.

So we've generated a [GitHub Style Guide docset][dash-feed] that gives you access to this site offline.

## Installation

1. First you'll need to make sure you have [Dash app][dash] installed.
2. Once installed, open the app, and click this [install docset link][dash-feed].
3. After the docset has been added to your list, click "download".
