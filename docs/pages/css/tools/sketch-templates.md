We often use Sketch for mocking up designs before coding them. To make this process faster and to keep our designs consistent, we have created UI kits that contain many of our commonly used styles.

## Product UI Kits

[The Product UI Kit](https://github.com/github/design/blob/master/resources/sketch/github-ui-kit.sketch) is a collection of our core GitHub UI styles and components suitable for building mockups. It also includes a starter page template with a site and repo header.

Don't waste time manually updating the Octicons artboard when icons are added, removed, or changed. See the [Octicons Sketch plugin](https://github.com/github/design/tree/master/resources/sketch/octicons-plugin) directory for a way to automate those updates.

## Email templates

[This email templates](https://github.com/github/design/blob/master/resources/sketch/email-templates.sketch) are a collection of current GitHub email templates which serve as a reference for new email designs.
