# Forms

Style individual form controls and utilize common layouts.

Overview:

- We reset several elements' default styles for cross browser consistency and easier manipulation later. This includes `<fieldset>`s, WebKit validation bubbles, and most textual `<input>`s.
- Specific types of textual `<input>`s are styled automatically, but `.form-control` is available should you need it.
- Always declare a `type` on your `<button>`s.
- Form layouts rely on form groups.

## Kitchen sink

All our inputs and buttons side-by-side for easy testing of sizing and alignment with one another.

<Story story={FormsStories.KitchenSink} />

## Example form

Form controls in Primer CSS currently have no basic layout specified (this is by design). You'll need to use `<fieldset>`s, `<div>`s, or other elements and styles to rearrange them.

<Story story={FormsStories.BasicForm} />

## Inputs

### Sizing

Make inputs smaller, larger, or full-width with an additional class.

<Story story={FormsStories.Sizes} />

### Input group

Attached an input and button to one another.

<Story story={FormsStories.InputGroup} />

## Customization

### Form contrast

Textual form controls have a white background by default. You can change this to a light gray with `.input-contrast`.

<Story story={FormsStories.Contrast} />

### Disabled state

Add the `disabled` attribute to make a `.form-control` appear disabled.

<Story story={FormsStories.Disabled} />

### Hide WebKit's contact info autofill icon

WebKit sometimes gets confused and tries to add an icon/dropdown to autofill contact information on fields that may not be appropriate (such as input for number of users). Use this class to override the display of this icon.

<Story story={FormsStories.HideWebkitAutofill} />

## Selects

Primer CSS adds light `height` and `vertical-align` styles to `<select>`s for all browsers to render them consistently with textual inputs.

<Story story={FormsStories.Select} />

### Small

Use the `.select-sm` class to resize both default and custom `<select>`s to match the size of [our small buttons](./buttons#default-buttons).

<Story story={FormsStories.SelectSmall} />

## Form groups

<Story story={FormsStories.FormGroup} />

## Form group validation (deprecated)

These form validation styles are deprecated. Please use the <a href="https://primer.style/view-components/components/alpha/textfield#with-a-validation-message">TextField</a> ViewComponent instead or refer to the <a href="https://primer.style/design/ui-patterns/forms#validation">design guidelines</a>.

Convey success, errors and warnings for form groups. For github.com consider using the [`<auto-check>`](https://github.github.io/web-systems-documentation/#custom-elements-auto-check-md) element to perform server-side validation on an input.

### Success

If the input is **valid**, add the `.successed` class to the `<div class="form-group">` element. Next add/update a success message to the `.note` element, as well as the `.success` class.

<Story story={FormsStories.ValidationSuccess} />

### Error

If the input is **not valid**, add the `.errored` class to the `<div class="form-group">` element. Next add/update an error message to the `.note` element, as well as the `.error` class.

<Story story={FormsStories.ValidationError} />

### Warning

If the input should show a **warning**, add the `.warn` class to the `<div class="form-group">` element. Next add/update a warning message to the `.note` element, as well as the `.warning` class.

<Story story={FormsStories.ValidationWarning} />

### Form actions

Align buttons to the right—via `float: right` on the buttons—in forms with `.form-actions`. The floats are automatically cleared for you.

<Story story={FormsStories.FormActions} />

## Checkboxes and radios

Utilities to control alignment and styling of checkbox and radio controls.

<Story story={FormsStories.CheckboxAndRadios} />

### Toggle content visibility based on a checkbox or radio button state

Content that is hidden by default should only be done so if it is non-essential for the context of the surrounding content. Be sure to use the `aria-live="polite"` attribute on the parent label for added content to be announced when displayed.

<Story story={FormsStories.ToggleVisibility} />

## Radio group

Radio groups are tab like controls. Their blue border gives extra emphasis to what is selected.

<Story story={FormsStories.RadioGroup} />

Adding `octicon` icons is also supported. To disable an option, use the `disabled` attribute.

<Story story={FormsStories.WithOcticons} />
