# Marketing links

Marketing links can be produced by combining the base class `link-mktg` with a set of modifier classes to control the size and color.

<Story story={MarketingStories.Link} />

## Link sizes

The marketing link size is defined with utility classes and come in large (`.f3-mktg`) and small (`.f4-mktg`):

## Link with emphasis

Add class `link-emphasis-mktg` to the link, to give it a pale underline, that will fill up on hover.

<Story story={MarketingStories.LinkEmphasis} />

## Link colors

The link color is controlled with the [Primer color classes](/utilities/colors), while the symbol and underline styling will follow:

<Story story={MarketingStories.LinkColors} />
