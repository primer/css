# SubNav

`.subnav` is navigation that is typically used when on a dashboard type interface with another set of navigation above it. This helps distinguish navigation hierarchy.

<Story story={SubNavStories.Default} />

You can have `subnav-search` in the subnav bar.

<Story story={SubNavStories.Search} />

You can also use a `subnav-search-context` to display search help in a select menu.

<Story story={SubNavStories.SearchContext} />
