# SubNav

`.subnav` is navigation that is typically used when on a dashboard type interface with another set of navigation above it. This helps distinguish navigation hierarchy.

You can have `subnav-search` in the subnav bar.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={SubNavStories.Search} />
</Canvas>

You can also use a `subnav-search-context` to display search help in a select menu.

  <Story story={SubNavStories.SearchContext} />
