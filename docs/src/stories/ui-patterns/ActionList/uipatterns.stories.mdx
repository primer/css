<Meta title="UI Patterns/UI Patterns" />

## UI Patterns

This directory contains pattern level stories that are used to compose component level stories. In general these stories consist of all markup/css that make up an overall "pattern" while component stories are more refined and focused on their own features and intent.

As an example, Overlay is a pattern used by Dialog, Anchored overlay, and "dropdown" type scenarios. Overlay is a set of styles reused for those core components, and provides its own set of stories to be inherited from the UI Patterns directory.

Consider these stories "private API" and use the stories within the `Components` directory as an official API reference.
