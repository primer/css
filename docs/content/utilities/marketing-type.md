The typography for our marketing pages differs from Primer CSS's core—it is responsive, on a slightly different scale, and headlines are set in the [defined marketing font](https://github.com/primer/css/blob/main/src/marketing/support/variables.scss).

## Heading Utilities

Use `.h0-mktg` – `.h6-mktg` to change an element's font, size, and weight on marketing pages.

```html live title="Heading Utilities"
<p class="h0-mktg">Heading 0</p>
<p class="h1-mktg">Heading 1</p>
<p class="h2-mktg">Heading 2</p>
<p class="h3-mktg">Heading 3</p>
<p class="h4-mktg">Heading 4</p>
<p class="h5-mktg">Heading 5</p>
<p class="h6-mktg">Heading 6</p>
```

## Typographic Utilities

These utilities are meant to be used in addition to Primer CSS's core utilities.

```html live title="Typographic Utilities"
<p class="pullquote">I'm a pullquote. Someone said these words in real life, and now they're on the internet</p>
```
