# Prototyping

You're welcome to use whatever prototyping tool suits your needs, however we've set up some options that will help you get started quickly.

The power of prototyping in code is that you can create clickable mocks that can be shared via a URL. This can be useful for exploring designs and interactions or for user research sessions. Prototypes can be throw-away, or part of your process for building out new features since you can work with the same CSS we use in production.

## Simple HTML prototype with Primer CSS

Copy the code below and paste it in a HTML file. The CDN link is always linked to the most up to date version of Primer CSS and includes all of the modules in the core, product, and marketing packages.

This method requires no dev environment set up and is useful for when you want to create simple prototypes using Primer CSS.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title></title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@primer/css@^19.0.0/dist/primer.css" />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

Note that the above loads a specific version of Primer CSS. You can also load the "latest" version with `https://unpkg.com/@primer/css/dist/primer.css`. Just be aware that it could include breaking changes. So for prototypes meant to last for a long time it's better to lock Primer CSS to a specific version.
