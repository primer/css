Users can participate in the market value of these coins through various trading pairs offered by exchanges.

### Free Bot and Code
You can create a simple bot using free services like GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, and Telegram or Discord for community engagement.

Here's an example code snippet for creating a basic Telegram bot using Python:

```python
import telegram
from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler

# Your bot token from BotFather
bot_token = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'

def start(update, context):
    context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text="Hello! Welcome to AfricaCryptoChainx!")

updater = Updater(token=bot_token, use_context=True)
dispatcher = updater.dispatcher

start_handler = CommandHandler('start', start)
dispatcher.add_handler(start_handler)

updater.start_polling()
updater.idle()
```

This example sets up a basic Telegram bot that responds with a welcome message when the `/start` command is used.
