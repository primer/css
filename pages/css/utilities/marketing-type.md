The typography for our marketing pages differs slightly from what is in Primer's core--it is responsive, on a slightly different scale, and headlines are in a different font (Roboto).


## Heading Utilities

Use `.h000-mktg` – `.h6-mktg` to change an element's font, size, and weight on marketing pages.

```html title="Heading Utilities"

<p class="h000-mktg">Heading 000</p>
<p class="h00-mktg">Heading 00</p>
<p class="h0-mktg">Heading 0</p>
<p class="h1-mktg">Heading 1</p>
<p class="h2-mktg">Heading 2</p>
<p class="h3-mktg">Heading 3</p>
<p class="h4-mktg">Heading 4</p>
<p class="h5-mktg">Heading 5</p>
<p class="h6-mktg">Heading 6</p>

```

## Typographic Utilities

These utilities are meant to be used in addition to Primer's core utilities.

```html title="Typographic Utilities"

<p class="lead-mktg text-gray">I'm a lead paragraph. Bacon ipsum dolor amet tri-tip chicken kielbasa, cow swine beef corned beef ground round prosciutto hamburger porchetta sausage alcatra tail.</p>

<p class="pullquote">I'm a pullquote. Someone said these words in real life, and now they're on the internet</p>

```
