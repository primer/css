### In `github/github`:

1. Create a new branch

1. Update the primer version in your terminal  `bin/npm install @primer/css@<version>`. [primer/publish](/primer/publish) will create a check status listing the published version.
   * If you're working on a release candidate, the `<version>` will be suffixed with `-rc.<sha>`, where `<sha>` is the 7-character SHA of the most recently published commit.
   * Otherwise, your work will be published to the `canary` dist-tag as `0.0.0-sha.<sha>`.

1. If you need to make changes to github/github due to the Primer release, do them in a branch and merge _that_ into your release branch after testing.

1. Add or re-request reviewers and fix any breaking tests.

1. Test on review-lab.

1. Publish `@primer/css` to the `latest` dist-tag by merging the release branch and waiting for the publish action to finish.

1. Run `bin/npm install @primer/css@<version>` with the published version and commit the resulting changes.

1. Push your changes and fix any breaking tests.

1. Deploy! :rocket:


### Publish release tag
