1. Wait for your checks to pass, and take note of the version that [primer/publish] lists in your status checks.

    **ProTip:** The release candidate version will always be `<version>-rc.<sha>`, where `<version>` comes from the branch name and `<sha>` is the 7-character commit SHA.

### In `github/github`:

1. Create a new branch.

1. Update the Primer CSS version to the published release candidate with:

    ```sh
    bin/npm install @primer/css@<version>-rc.<sha>
    ```

    Then commit and push the changes to `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `vendor/npm`.

1. If you need to make changes to github/github due to the Primer release, do them in a branch and merge _that_ into your release branch after testing.

1. Add or re-request reviewers and fix any breaking tests.

1. Test on review-lab.

1. Publish `@primer/css` to the `latest` dist-tag by merging the release branch and waiting for [primer/publish] to finish.

1. Install the latest published version with:

    ```
    bin/npm install @primer/css@<version>
    ```

    Then commit and push the changes to `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `vendor/npm`.

1. Fix any breaking tests.

1. Deploy! :rocket:
